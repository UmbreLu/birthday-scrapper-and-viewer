# birthday-scrapper-and-viewer
Birthdays scrapper is a Python scrapper that scraps a website looking for scientists birthdays. But it's not so simple: in order to view every scientist birthday, you must access a whole new page, because in the main page with the scientists list, they just don't show it. So this scrapper automates this job and retrieves a database parsed in json format.
Created the database, Birthday_Database_Explorer is the perfect tool for accessing it and visualizing it.
Libs: BeautifulSoup, Requests, Matplotlib.
